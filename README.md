# YouTube Video Summarization Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of summarizing preferred YouTube channels and videos without having to watch each one individually. Users will input their preferred YouTube channels and video links along with brief descriptions. An AI-based solution will then query the YouTube API to collect transcripts, descriptions, links, view counts, and other relevant data for each video. Based on this data, the system will generate summaries for all videos, and then aggregate these summaries to create a preference list to help users identify which videos are worth watching.

## Features
* User input of preferred YouTube channels and video links.
* Retrieval of video data using the YouTube API.
* Extraction of transcripts, descriptions, links, and view counts for each video.
* Generation of summaries for individual videos.
* Aggregation of video summaries to create a preference list.
* Identification of recurring information across videos.
* User-friendly interface for inputting preferences and viewing summaries.

## Technologies Used
* Python for backend development.
* YouTube API for retrieving video data.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for transcript analysis.
* Markdown for formatting summaries and preference lists.
* Flask or Django for web application development (optional).

## Usage
* Input preferred YouTube channels and video links along with brief descriptions.
* Run the AI-based solution to query the YouTube API and collect video data.
* Generate summaries for individual videos based on collected data.
* Aggregate video summaries to create a preference list.
* Review the preference list to identify which videos are worth watching.

## Future Improvements
* Implementation of machine learning algorithms to improve summary generation.
* Integration of user feedback to refine preference list generation.
* Expansion of data sources beyond YouTube to include other video platforms.
* Enhancement of user interface for better usability and experience.
* Optimization of performance for handling large volumes of video data.
